## Introduction

* Tensorboard can be used independently. It can be used in pytorch, even in plain python code, not must be used with tensorflow framework together. 

* When write code with pytorch, you can also use tensorflow summary API to create log file, then using tensorboard to visual, analyze log info.

* Actually you just need to install tensorflow and only use summary API to create log file. 

* `DLLogger.py` include a simple demo code for the usage.
